/**
 * BusinessHoursService.swift
 * SipLocal
 *
 * Service responsible for business hours management.
 * Extracted from CartManager to follow Single Responsibility Principle.
 *
 * ## Responsibilities
 * - **Business Hours Fetching**: Retrieve hours from POS systems
 * - **Hours Caching**: Efficient caching with expiration
 * - **Open/Closed Status**: Real-time shop availability checking
 * - **Multi-POS Support**: Support different POS systems (Square, Clover)
 *
 * ## Architecture
 * - **Single Responsibility**: Focused only on business hours management
 * - **Caching Strategy**: Memory caching with TTL and size limits
 * - **POS Abstraction**: Clean interface for different POS systems
 * - **Performance**: Optimized fetching with concurrent operations
 *
