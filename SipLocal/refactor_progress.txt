SIPLOCAL REFACTORING PROGRESS
=============================

APPROACH: File-by-file refactoring following app execution flow
START DATE: $(date)

QUEUE (Files to Visit):
======================
1. MainView.swift (next in execution flow)
2. AuthenticationManager.swift (environment object dependency)
3. CartManager.swift (environment object dependency)  
4. OrderManager.swift (environment object dependency - check if exists)

VISITED (Files Refactored):
==========================
✅ SipLocalApp.swift - COMPLETED
   - Extracted AppConfiguration struct for centralized config
   - Created ServiceConfigurationManager for service initialization
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Better separation of concerns
   - ✅ SECURITY FIX: Moved API keys to Config.plist (excluded from version control)
   - Created Config.template.plist for safe development setup
   - Added configuration validation with proper error messages
   - Added debug configuration printing

DEPENDENCIES DISCOVERED:
=======================
From SipLocalApp.swift:
- MainView.swift (direct dependency in body)
- AuthenticationManager.swift (@StateObject)
- CartManager.swift (@StateObject)
- OrderManager.swift (@StateObject - need to verify location)

NOTES:
======
- Following app execution flow starting from @main
- Refactoring one file at a time
- Adding dependencies to queue as discovered
- Stopping after each file for approval
