SIPLOCAL REFACTORING PROGRESS
=============================

APPROACH: File-by-file refactoring following app execution flow
START DATE: $(date)

QUEUE (Files to Visit):
======================
1. ContentView.swift (unauthenticated path from MainView)
2. EmailVerificationView.swift (authenticated unverified path from MainView)
3. HomeView.swift (authenticated verified path from MainView)
4. AuthenticationManager.swift (environment object dependency)
5. CartManager.swift (environment object dependency)  
6. OrderManager.swift (environment object dependency - check if exists)

VISITED (Files Refactored):
==========================
✅ SipLocalApp.swift - COMPLETED
   - Extracted AppConfiguration struct for centralized config
   - Created ServiceConfigurationManager for service initialization
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Better separation of concerns
   - ✅ SECURITY FIX: Moved API keys to Config.plist (excluded from version control)
   - Created Config.template.plist for safe development setup
   - Added configuration validation with proper error messages
   - Added debug configuration printing

✅ MainView.swift - COMPLETED (Simple Approach)
   - Added comprehensive documentation explaining navigation paths
   - Removed redundant environment object passing (already injected at app level)
   - Fixed preview by adding required AuthenticationManager dependency
   - Added clear comments for each navigation branch
   - Kept the core logic simple and readable

DEPENDENCIES DISCOVERED:
=======================
From SipLocalApp.swift:
- MainView.swift (direct dependency in body) ✅ COMPLETED
- AuthenticationManager.swift (@StateObject)
- CartManager.swift (@StateObject)
- OrderManager.swift (@StateObject - need to verify location)

From MainView.swift:
- ContentView.swift (unauthenticated flow)
- EmailVerificationView.swift (authenticated unverified flow)
- HomeView.swift (authenticated verified flow)
- AuthenticationManager.swift (environment dependency)

NOTES:
======
- Following app execution flow starting from @main
- Refactoring one file at a time
- Adding dependencies to queue as discovered
- Stopping after each file for approval
