SIPLOCAL REFACTORING PROGRESS
=============================

APPROACH: File-by-file refactoring following app execution flow
START DATE: $(date)

QUEUE (Files to Visit):
======================
1. ForgotPasswordView.swift (navigation destination from LoginView)
2. SignupView.swift (signup flow from ContentView)
3. EmailVerificationView.swift (authenticated unverified path from MainView)
4. HomeView.swift (authenticated verified path from MainView)
5. AuthenticationManager.swift (environment object dependency)
6. CartManager.swift (environment object dependency)  
7. OrderManager.swift (environment object dependency - check if exists)

VISITED (Files Refactored):
==========================
✅ SipLocalApp.swift - COMPLETED
   - Extracted AppConfiguration struct for centralized config
   - Created ServiceConfigurationManager for service initialization
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Better separation of concerns
   - ✅ SECURITY FIX: Moved API keys to Config.plist (excluded from version control)
   - Created Config.template.plist for safe development setup
   - Added configuration validation with proper error messages
   - Added debug configuration printing

✅ MainView.swift - COMPLETED (Simple Approach)
   - Added comprehensive documentation explaining navigation paths
   - Removed redundant environment object passing (already injected at app level)
   - Fixed preview by adding required AuthenticationManager dependency
   - Added clear comments for each navigation branch
   - Kept the core logic simple and readable

✅ ContentView.swift - COMPLETED
   - Extracted LoopingVideoPlayer component with cleaner implementation
   - Created Design enum for centralized styling constants
   - Broke down large view into smaller, focused computed properties
   - Added proper video memory management with cleanup
   - Implemented async video loading with error handling
   - Created VideoError enum for structured error handling
   - Removed redundant environment object passing
   - Added comprehensive documentation and MARK sections

✅ LoginView.swift - COMPLETED
   - Created CustomTextField and CustomSecureField reusable components
   - Added Design enum for centralized styling constants
   - Implemented client-side form validation with visual feedback
   - Broke down large view into focused computed properties
   - Added proper error handling with main thread dispatch
   - Improved button states (disabled when invalid/loading)
   - Enhanced user experience with form validation feedback
   - Added comprehensive documentation and MARK sections

DEPENDENCIES DISCOVERED:
=======================
From SipLocalApp.swift:
- MainView.swift (direct dependency in body) ✅ COMPLETED
- AuthenticationManager.swift (@StateObject)
- CartManager.swift (@StateObject)
- OrderManager.swift (@StateObject - need to verify location)

From MainView.swift:
- ContentView.swift (unauthenticated flow) ✅ COMPLETED
- EmailVerificationView.swift (authenticated unverified flow)
- HomeView.swift (authenticated verified flow)
- AuthenticationManager.swift (environment dependency)

From ContentView.swift:
- LoginView.swift (navigation destination) ✅ COMPLETED
- SignupView.swift (navigation destination)
- AuthenticationManager.swift (environment dependency)

From LoginView.swift:
- ForgotPasswordView.swift (navigation destination)
- AuthenticationManager.swift (environment dependency)

NOTES:
======
- Following app execution flow starting from @main
- Refactoring one file at a time
- Adding dependencies to queue as discovered
- Stopping after each file for approval
